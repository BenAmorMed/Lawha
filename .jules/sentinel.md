## 2026-03-08 - [Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in Orders]
**Vulnerability:** The `GET /api/v1/orders/:id` endpoint lacked ownership verification, allowing any user to view sensitive order data (shipping details, items) by guessing or obtaining a UUID.
**Learning:** Routes that support both guest and authenticated users often miss proper `req.user` population, leading to bypassed ownership checks in services when they rely on an optional `userId` parameter.
**Prevention:** Use an `OptionalJwtAuthGuard` to consistently populate `req.user` even on public-facing routes, and explicitly check if an object has a `userId` before allowing access without a matching authenticated ID. Use `NotFoundException` (404) for access denial to avoid leaking resource existence.

## 2026-03-09 - [Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in Images]
**Vulnerability:** The `GET /api/v1/images/:id` (metadata) endpoint was public and lacked ownership verification, allowing any user to view image metadata (dimensions, DPI, quality) by ID.
**Learning:** Security logic must be consistent across all CRUD operations. While `deleteImage` had ownership checks, the metadata endpoint was overlooked.
**Prevention:** Ensure all endpoints that retrieve or modify user-owned resources include ownership verification. Propagate `userId` to services even for public-facing "metadata" or "status" routes using `OptionalJwtAuthGuard`.

## 2026-03-25 - [Price Manipulation and SQL Injection]
**Vulnerability:** The `PaymentController` trusted the client-provided `amount` for Stripe payments, and the `AdminService` allowed unsanitized `sortBy` fields in database queries.
**Learning:** Never trust transaction amounts from the client; always derive them from the source of truth (database). Dynamic ordering in TypeORM is a common vector for SQL injection if not whitelisted at runtime.
**Prevention:** Hardcode whitelists for dynamic query parameters like sort fields and directions. Derive payment amounts exclusively from the database based on the verified resource ID.
