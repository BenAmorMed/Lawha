## 2026-03-08 - [Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in Orders]
**Vulnerability:** The `GET /api/v1/orders/:id` endpoint lacked ownership verification, allowing any user to view sensitive order data (shipping details, items) by guessing or obtaining a UUID.
**Learning:** Routes that support both guest and authenticated users often miss proper `req.user` population, leading to bypassed ownership checks in services when they rely on an optional `userId` parameter.
**Prevention:** Use an `OptionalJwtAuthGuard` to consistently populate `req.user` even on public-facing routes, and explicitly check if an object has a `userId` before allowing access without a matching authenticated ID. Use `NotFoundException` (404) for access denial to avoid leaking resource existence.

## 2026-03-09 - [Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in Images]
**Vulnerability:** The `GET /api/v1/images/:id` (metadata) endpoint was public and lacked ownership verification, allowing any user to view image metadata (dimensions, DPI, quality) by ID.
**Learning:** Security logic must be consistent across all CRUD operations. While `deleteImage` had ownership checks, the metadata endpoint was overlooked.
**Prevention:** Ensure all endpoints that retrieve or modify user-owned resources include ownership verification. Propagate `userId` to services even for public-facing "metadata" or "status" routes using `OptionalJwtAuthGuard`.

## 2026-06-04 - [SQL Injection Risk in Dynamic Ordering]
**Vulnerability:** The `AdminService.getAllOrders` method directly interpolated user-provided strings into the `orderBy` clause, creating a potential SQL injection vector.
**Learning:** Security fixes are often applied inconsistently. While `getAllReviews` had whitelisting, `getAllOrders` in the same service was overlooked.
**Prevention:** Always use a strict whitelist for dynamic database identifiers (table names, column names) that cannot be parameterized by the ORM. Centralize sorting logic or use DTOs with strict validation to ensure only allowed fields are used.
